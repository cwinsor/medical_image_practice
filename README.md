# medical_image_practice
This git is a set of practice exercises focusing on machine vision (segmentation, localization, classification) from medical images.

* 00_uw_madison_preprocess: perform preprocessing of the UW-Madison dataset
* 01_cars: an example from Torch showing image segmentation
* 02a_11th_place: 
* 02b_uw_madison: create a segmentation model of UW-Madison dataset. This uses the data from the "00" folder. 

CONDA ENVIRONMENT:

* The environment is Ubuntu (I use WSL on Windows).
* On my compute host the conda env is named "pytorch_medical_image_practice"
* Instructions to generate the environment are in 02b_uw_madison/setup_localhost.py
